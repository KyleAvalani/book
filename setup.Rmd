# Getting Setup {#machine-setup}

This course will cover a wide variety of tools and techniques used in modern web development, including different software programs that are used to write, manage, and execute the code for your web application. This chapter explains how to install and use some of the software you will need to utilize.

<p class="alert alert-info">Note that iSchool lab machines should have all appropriate software already installed and ready to use.</p>

In summary, you'll need to install and set up the following software on your machine (more information below on each of these). Feel free to use alternative software, but these are the suggested programs for the course (i.e., the ones which we will provide support for):

- A modern web browser such as [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a JavaScript engine
- [**`npm`**](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a JavaScript package manager (comes with Node.js)
- [**`git`**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as a version control system (for Windows users; already installed on Macs)
- A Bash terminal (e.g., the [**subsystem for Linux**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) or [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Windows; Terminal is already installed on Macs)
- [**`live-server`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) as a local development server (simply run `npm install live-server`)

## Web Browser

The first thing you'll need is a web browser for viewing the web pages you make! We recommend you install and utilize [**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html), which comes with an effective set of built-in [developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) that will be especially useful in this class. We recommend Chrome primarily for historical reasons (and because it is the browser used by the authors&mdash;and we had to pick one!)

- You can access the Chrome Developer tools by selecting **View > Developer > Developer Tools** from Chrome's main menu (`cmd + option + i` on a Mac, `ctrl + shift + i` on Windows). You will pretty much always want to have these tools open when doing web development, especially when including interactivity via JavaScript.

Other modern browsers such as [**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [**Microsoft Edge**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) will also function perfectly well in this course and include their own versions of the required development tools. Note that different browsers may and will render code in different ways, which will be discussed extensively throughout the course.

We strongly suggest that you don't use Safari, as it has a number of user interface and rendering issues that make it difficult to develop with for this course.

## Code Editors

In order to write web code, you need somewhere to write it. There are a variety of code editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that are specialized for web development, providing syntax highlighting, code completion, and other useful functionality. There are lots of different code editors out there, all of which have slightly different appearances and features. You only need to download and use one of the following programs (we recommend **Visual Studio Code** as a default), but feel free to try out different ones to find something you like (and then evangelize about it to your friends!)

### Visual Studio Code {-}

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or VS Code; not to be confused with Visual Studio) is a free, open-source editor developed by Microsoft&mdash;yes, really. It focuses on web programming and JavaScript, though also supports many other languages and provides a number of [community-built extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) for adding even more features. Although fairly new, it is updated regularly and has has become one of our main editors for programming. VS Code is actually a stand-alone web application, so it's written in the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you'll learn in this course!

To install VS Code, follow the above link and Click the "Download" button to download the installer (e.g, `.exe`) file, then double-click on that to install the application.

Once you've installed VS Code, the trick to using it effectively is to get comfortable with the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette). If you hit `cmd + shift + p`, VS Code will open a small dialog where you can search for whatever you want the editor to do. For example, if you type in `markdown` you can get list of commands related to Markdown files (including the ability to open up a preview). The `Format Code` option is particularly useful.

For more information about using VS Code, see [the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), which includes [videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) if you find them useful. The documentation for programming in [HTML](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html), [CSS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/css), and especially [JavaScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript) also contain lots of tips and tricks.

<!-- #### Recommended Extensions
We suggest you install the following extensions to help you write well formatted code:

- [JSHint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.jshint) for catching JavaScript errors

In order to get the linter set up, you'll also need to global install `jshint` with this command on the terminal (more info on using `npm` below):

```bash
npm install -g jshint
```

Furthermore, we suggest the following user-settings to make using your text editor even easier (hit `cmd + ,` to get to your user settings):

```json
// Remove this comment and the comments at the end of each line -- these are for informational purposes, but will not work in your settings
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,        // have the text editor auto-format your code when you save 
  "editor.tabSize": 4,                // set the tab size to 4 spaces
  "editor.detectIndentation": false,  // don't have the text editor detect tabs v.s. spaces 
  "jshint.enable": true,              // enable the jshint linter
    "jshint.options": {
        "strict": "global",           // require JavaScript files to declare "use strict";
        "esversion": 6,               // set es version to 6
        "devel": true,                // enable debugging commands like "console.log"
        "browser": true               // enable browser variables like "document"
    }
}
``` -->

While we suggest using VSCode for this course, other editors are also acceptable and may be of interest to you.

### Atom {-}

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a text editor built by the folks at GitHub and has been gaining in popularity. It is very similar to VS Code in terms of features, but has a somewhat different interface and community. It has a similar _command-palette_ to VS Code. The document you are reading was authored in Atom.

### Brackets {-}

[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is a coding editor created by Adobe specialized for client-side web developers. It has some intriguing features that are not yet in Visual Studio Code, as well as possibly the nicest interface of this list.

### Sublime Text {-}

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) is a very popular text editor with excellent defaults and a variety of available extensions (though you'll need to manage and install extensions to achieve the functionality offered by other editors out of the box). While the software can be used for free, every 20 or so saves it will prompt you to purchase the full version. This is a great option to write a plain text file.

## Bash (Command Line)

Many of the software tools used in professional web development are used on the **command line**: a text-based interface for controlling your computer. While the command line is harder to learn and figure out, it is particularly effective for doing web development. Command line automation is powerful and efficient enough to handle the dozens of repeated tasks across hundreds of different source files (split across multiple computers) commonly found in web programming. You will need to be comfortable using the command line in order to utilize the software for this course.

While there are multiple different **command shells** (command line interfaces), this course is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> shell, which provides a particular common set of commands common to Mac and Linux machines.

On a Mac you'll want to use the built-in app called **Terminal**. You can open it by searching via Spotlight (hit Cmd (`âŒ˜`) and Spacebar together, type in "terminal", then select the app to open it), or by finding it in the Applications/Utilities folder.

On Windows, we recommend setting up the [**Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). This will let you turn the Windows command prompt into a full-blown Bash shell just by typing the command **`bash`**. (Technically you're running a small copy of the Linux operating system inside of your Windows install, but we're just going to need the Bash shell).

- Follow the instructions linked above to install the WSL. You will need to download a Linux distribution (e.g., from the Windows store); just using the default Ubuntu version is fine.

- Note that Windows does come with its own command-prompt, called the _Command Prompt_ (previously the _DOS Prompt_), but it has a different set of commands and features. _Powershell_ is a more powerful version of the Command Prompt if you really want to get into the Windows Management Framework. But Bash is more common in open-source programming like we'll be doing, and so we will be focusing on that set of commands.

Alternatively, on windows you can use the [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) shell, which you should install along with `git` (see below). Open this program to open the command-shell.

<p class="alert alert-danger">This course expects you to already be familiar with basic command line usage. For review, see [The Command Line](https://info201.github.io/command-line.html) in the _INFO 201_ course reader.</p>

## Git and GitHub

Professional web development involves many different people working on many different files. **`git`** is a collaborative version control system that provides a set of commands that allow you to manage changes to written code, particularly when collaborating with other programmers.

You will need to [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install the software. If you are on a Mac, `git` should already be installed. If you are using a Windows machine, then installing `git` will also install the Git Bash command shell.

Note that `git` is a command line application: you can test that it is installed by running the command:

```bash
git --version
```

While `git` is the software used to manage versions of code, [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) is a website that is used to store copies of computer code that are being managed with `git` (think "Imgur for code").

In order to use GitHub, you'll need to [create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one. You should register a username that is identifiable as you (e.g., based on your name or your UW NetID). This will make it easier for others to determine out who contributed what code, rather than needing to figure out who 'LeetDesigner2099' is. This can be the start of a professional account you may use for the rest of your career!

- Note that you can have `git` save your GitHub password on your local machine so you don't have to type it repeatedly. See [_Authenticating with GitHub from Git_](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git).

<p class="alert alert-danger">This course expects you to already be familiar with utilizing Git and GitHub. For review, see
[Git and GitHub](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), [Git Branches](https://info201.github.io/git-branches.html), and [Git Collaboration](https://info201.github.io/git-collaboration.html)
in the _INFO 201_ course reader. Note that students in the INFO 340 course will be using GitHub and Pull Requests to turn in programming assignments.</p>

## Node and `npm`

[**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) (commonly just "Node") is a a command line runtime environment for the JavaScript programming language&mdash;that is, a program that is used to _interpret_ and _execute_ programming instructions written in JavaScript. Although client-side development usually involves running JavaScript in the browser (see [Chapter: JavaScript](#JavaScript)), Node provides a platform for installing and running a wide variety of "helper" programs that are frequently used in web development.

The best way to install Node is to use [**`nvm`**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), the Node Version Manager. This is a command line program that manages installing the Node command line program, but also makes it easy to update or adjust your Node installation. (It also installs the same way on Mac or Windows WSL). You can install `nvm` and Node with the following Bash commands:

```bash
## Run from your home directory:

touch ~/.bash_profile
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash

## Restart the command shell

nvm install node
nvm use node
nvm alias default node
```

You can then test that node is installed and working with

```bash
node --version
```

Be sure and check that you have a recent enough version! At time of this writing, you need Node v10.16 or later.

Installing Node also installs an additional command line program called [**`npm`**](https://www.npmjs.com/). `npm` is a **package manager**, or a program used to "manage" other programs&mdash;think of it as a command line "app store" for developer tools and libraries. `npm` is the most common way of installing and running a large number of tools used in professional web development. At the time of writing, the `npm` "registry" lists around 725,000 different packages.

<p class="alert alert-warning">If you have an older version of Node and `npm` (before Node 10.16 or `npm` 5.6), you will need to update them. You can re-install the latest version of Node as above, or just upgrade `npm` using the command **`npm install npm@latest -g`**. See below for an explanation of this command.</p>


### Managing packages with npm {-}


You can use the `npm` program to download and install command line programs by name:

```bash
npm install -g PACKAGE-NAME
```

For example, you can install the [_live-server_](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) utility (a simple program that runs a local web server and will automatically "refresh" the browser when your code changes) using:

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

- Once the program is done installing, you can run it from the command line by using the command `live-server`. This program will serve all of the content from the current directory. See [Chapter 2](#web-servers) for details.

Importantly, note the included **`-g`** option. This tells `npm` that the package should be installed **globally**, making it available across the entire computer, rather than just from a particular folder. Because you want to be able to use a command line utility like _live-server_ from any folder (e.g., for any project), command line utilities are always installed globally with the `-g` option.

It is also possible to omit that option and install a package _locally_. For example:

```bash
npm install lodash
```

Will download the [`lodash`](https://lodash.com/) code library (a set of useful JavaScript functions). This package will be placed into a new folder _in the current project directory_ called `node_modules/`, and can be imported and used in the current directory's code. (It's called a local install because the package is only available to the "local" project). You will of course need to install local packages once per project.

<p class="alert alert-warning">Because node packages can be very large, and projects can have lots of them, you want to be sure to **not** commit the `node_modules/` folder to version control. Make sure that the folder is listed in your `.gitignore` file!</p>

### `package.json` {-}

As projects become large, it is common for them to build up many _dependencies_: packages that must be installed in order for the program to work. In other words, there needs to be a certain set of packages in the project's `node_modules/` folder. `npm` is able to keep track of these dependencies by recording them in a specialized file called `package.json` that can be placed inside the project directory. A `package.json` file is a text file containing a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) list of information about your project. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "description": "A project with an example package.json",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "author": "Joel Ross",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.4",
    "moment": "^2.18.1"
	},
  "devDependencies": {
    "html-validator": "^2.2.2"
  }
}
```

(You can create one of these files by using the command `npm init` in the current project directory, and then following the instructions to fill in the fields).

Notice that there are two packages listed under `"dependencies"`: `lodash` and `moment` (the `^4.17.4` indicates which version of `lodash`). You can use `npm` to automatically install all of the packages listed under `"dependencies"` (as well as under `"devDependencies"`) using the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Thus using `npm install` without any arguments means "install all of the requirements that have been listed for this project". This is a good first step _any time_ you download a project or checkout a repository from GitHub.

When installing specific packages, `npm` automatically adds them to the dependencies list in the `package.json`, though you can make this explicit with the `--save` option:

```bash
# explicitly save dependency in package.json
npm install --save lodash
```

Similarly, the `--save-dev` option will instead save the package in the `"devDependencies"` list, which are dependencies needed only for development (writing the program's code) and not for execution (running the program).

If you want to use a _globally_ installed package in your local project (e.g., have it be a dependency but not have to download and install it again), you can use `npm link` to "include" the global package locally. For example, the below will allow you to use a globally installed version of `lodash` so you don't have to download a copy for the project:

```bash
npm link lodash
```

Be sure to `link` any global packages _before_ you run `npm install` so you don't download any packages from `package.json` that you already have!

You can uninstall packages using `npm uninstall`, or can remove packages from the dependencies lists simply by editing the `package.json` file (e.g., with VS Code).

To sum up, you will use three commands with `npm` to install packages:

1. `npm install -g PACKAGE-NAME` to _globally_ install command line programs.
2. `npm install` to _locally_ install all of the dependencies for a project you check out.
3. `npm install PACKAGE-NAME` to _locally_ install a new code package and record it in the `package.json` file.

<p class="alert alert-info">While `npm` is the most popular package manager (and the one utilized in this course), there are others as well. For example, [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a package manager created by Facebook that is [compatible](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm) with `npm` and is quickly growing in popularity. Note that you will generally need to use one package manager or other; don't try to mix them in a single project!</p>
